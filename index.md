# Project Overview

  As a recent Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduate from Calvin College looking to extend his 
  Optional Practical Training (OPT) I found it difficult to determine what companies to target since the requirements eeded by the
  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were often found in obscure csv files in often obscure websites. 
  
  I decided to ompile, parse and visualize the available data hoping it makes it easier for other international students and graduates
  to identify states and counties with large amounts of E verify employers.
  
# Data Sources

  The data on E verify employers can be found following this [link](https://www.e-verify.gov/about-e-verify/e-verify-data/participating-employers).
  
  Data on zipcodes was imported using the python packages zipcodes and uszipcode.
  
  Data on counties, major cities and capital cities was download from the site [downloadexcelfiles](https://www.downloadexcelfiles.com/wo_en/download-excel-file-list-cities-us#.XAGXe2hKiHs)
